# Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Microsoft Entra ID

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Microsoft Entra ID is a powerful tool that helps organizations manage, control, and monitor access to critical resources. It minimizes security risks by providing just-in-time access and enforcing strict controls over privileged roles.

### **Why Use PIM?**

- **Minimize Risk**: Reduces the number of users with permanent access to sensitive resources, lowering the chances of accidental or malicious changes.
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Grants temporary permissions only when needed, ensuring access is limited to specific tasks.
- **Compliance and Oversight**: Tracks and audits role activations, making it easier to meet compliance requirements.

### **Key Features**

1. **Time-Based Access**: Assign roles with start and end dates for temporary access.
2. **Approval Workflows**: Require approval for activating privileged roles.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for role activation.
4. **Justifications**: Users must provide reasons for activating roles.
5. **Notifications**: Alerts when roles are activated or modified.
6. **Access Reviews**: Regularly review role assignments to ensure continued necessity.
7. **Audit History**: Maintain logs for internal or external audits.

### **Types of Role Assignments**

- **Eligible Roles**: Users must activate these roles before use, often requiring MFA or approval.
- **Active Roles**: Users have immediate access without additional steps.
- **Time-Bound Roles**: Access is limited to a specific timeframe.

### **How to Get Started with PIM**

1. **Access PIM in Entra ID Portal**:
   - Navigate to the *Identity Governance* blade in the Microsoft Entra Admin portal and select *Privileged Identity Management*.
2. **Assign Roles**:
   - Assign users as either "eligible" or "active" for specific roles with defined scopes and durations.
3. **Activate Roles**:
   - Eligible users activate their roles by providing justification, completing MFA, or requesting approval.
4. **Approve Requests**:
   - Approvers receive notifications for pending requests and can approve or deny them directly in the portal.
5. **Review and Audit**:
   - Conduct periodic access reviews to ensure users still need their assigned roles.

### **Best Practices**

- Follow the *Principle of Least Privilege*: Grant users only the minimum permissions necessary for their tasks
- Use *Access Reviews* regularly to validate role assignments.
- Enable notifications to stay informed about role activations and changes.

### **Common Scenarios**

- Temporary access for IT administrators during critical operations.
- Controlled access to sensitive Azure resources or Microsoft 365 data.
- Delegating approvals for role activations to specific teams.

By implementing PIM, organizations can enhance security, streamline access management, and maintain compliance with ease.
